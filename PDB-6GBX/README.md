# Case Study: Integrating Flare GIST with SAR data to clarify ambiguous binding mode

## Overview

In the structure of PDB 6GBX, the ligand SEN177 exhibits two distinct binding modes: Chain A and Chain B. Analysis of the binding pocket using Flare GIST (https://lnkd.in/gMa2_xyZ) revealed that the binding mode in Chain A does not align with the SAR reported by Yu et al. (2023, https://lnkd.in/g4Qp4jTU ), whereas the binding mode in Chain B does. In this case, GIST analysis proved instrumental in identifying the correct ligand binding mode.
