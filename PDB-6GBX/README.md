# Case Study: Integrating Flare GIST with SAR data to clarify ambiguous binding mode

## Overview

In the structure of PDB 6GBX, the ligand SEN177 exhibits two distinct binding modes: Chain A and Chain B. Analysis of the binding pocket using Flare GIST (https://lnkd.in/gMa2_xyZ) revealed that the binding mode in Chain A does not align with the SAR reported by Yu et al. (2023, https://lnkd.in/g4Qp4jTU ), whereas the binding mode in Chain B does. In this case, GIST analysis proved instrumental in identifying the correct ligand binding mode.

"Fascinating analysis—great example of how integrating computational tools Flare GIST with SAR data can clarify ambiguous binding modes. The discrepancy between Chain A and Chain B really highlights the importance of solvent energetics in guiding ligand interpretation. Thanks for sharing this detailed case study!" — Dr. Awantika Shrivastava, commenting on my LinkedIn post.
