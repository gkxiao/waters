## Overview
​Cracking the Water Code in Drug Design: When Happy vs. Unhappy Waters Dictate Activity 💧⚗️​

Trujillo et al.'s study "A Tale of Two Waters"(https://lnkd.in/gPnbfRYv) revealed paradoxical water-mediated SAR in hH-PGDS inhibitors:
- ➡️ Replacing HOH320 caused 630× activity loss
- ➡️ Displacing HOH305 showed only 3.5× potency reduction

Why such dramatic differences? Flare's GIST (https://lnkd.in/gAUbF4_a) Analysis Provides Answers:
- 🔍 HOH320 is a "happy" water (ΔG = -2.37 kcal/mol, apo-GIST)
- 🔍 HOH305 is a "unhappy" water (ΔG = 1.81 kcal/mol, apo-GIST)

Key Takeaway for Medicinal Chemists:​​
- ✅ ​​Happy waters​​ = Activity guardians → Preserve them!
- ✅ ​​Unhappy waters​​ = Design opportunities → Target for displacement
