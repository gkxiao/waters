<p>Trujillo et al.'s "A Tale of Two Waters"(https://lnkd.in/gPnbfRYv)  revealed paradoxical water-mediated SAR in hH-PGDS inhibitors:</p>

➡️ Replacing HOH320 caused 630x activity loss
➡️ Displacing HOH305 only showed 3.5x potency reduction

Why such dramatic differences? Flare's GIST (https://lnkd.in/gAUbF4_a) Analysis Provides Answers:
🔍 HOH320 is a "happy" water (ΔG = -2.37 kcal/mol, apo-GIST)
🔍 HOH305 is a "unhappy" water (ΔG = 1.81 kcal/mol, apo-GIST)

Key Takeaway for Medicinal Chemists:​​
✅ ​​Happy waters​​ = Activity guardians → Preserve them!
✅ ​​Unhappy waters​​ = Design opportunities → Target for displacement
