## GIST-Assisted Ligand Binding Mode Recognition: A Case Study
In this case study, GIST results were utilized to identify the binding modes of Fragment 1 and 2 in the CGRP receptor binding pocket, as reported by Naohide Morita et al., thereby providing a high-quality foundation for FBDD.

### How are GIST results utilized in this case study?
According to the findings of Takashi Yoshidome et al.:
>Based on the gO(r) for the crystallographic binding pose of the ligand, hydrogen bond interactions are dominant in the highly hydrated regions while weak interactions such as CH-O are dominant in the moderately hydrated regions. The polar heteroatoms of the ligand occupy the highly hydrated and moderately hydrated regions in the crystallographic (correct) and wrongly docked (incorrect) poses, respectively. Thus, the gO(r) of polar heteroatoms may be used to distinguish the correct binding poses.

###  What is the efficacy of this approach?
Based on Takashi Yoshidome et al.'s conclusions regarding the relationship between correct binding poses and hydration density, the Flare Docking results revealed binding modes for Fragment 1 and 2 that are consistent with biophysical experiments. Furthermore, these findings visually indicate a fusion strategy for Fragment 1 and 2.
